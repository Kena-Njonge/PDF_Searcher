# PDF_Searcher
A python program that takes a list of strings and a pdf as its input and creates a pdf that contains only the pages that include words from the list

How to use
1. Insert string of target words into first box e.g. "Next bread cat". (without quotation marks)
2. Insert path of file you want to search e.g. "F:/Users/Local/Downloads/Target.pdf" (with or without quotation marks)
3. Insert output file name e.g "Output" (without quotation marks)
4. Insert output directory e.g "F:/Users/Local/Downloads/" (without quotation marks)
5. Press ok

I plan on working on this and improving aspects as time goes by, including the quotation mark inconsistencies. Enjoy.
